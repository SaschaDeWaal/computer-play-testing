# Computer Play testing



### Introduction

So what does 'Computer play testing' mean? it's like a play test with humans, where you let them play the game and learn on the fly about the balance and the game mechanics. But this time the computer is playing the game instead of a human. 

This is the repo where you can find 2 examples, a tutorial about this topic and the framework itself.
